The Customer is responsible for promptly notifying PTI QCS of any suspected defect in work-manship or service and agrees to provide PTI QCS with a sample of the defective part and information necessary to allow tracing of the suspected defect including, but not limited to, part, serial, lot numbers, and manufacturing date. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the liability of each Party and its Affiliates arising under this Agreement is limited to direct damages up to the amount the Customer was required to pay for the Services giving rise to that liability. These limitations apply regardless of whether the liability is based on breach of contract or otherwise.

			18. Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including this Contract, and other documents referred therein) constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement supersedes any prior agreements, oral or written, between the parties concerning the subject matter hereof.<br/>
			19. Amendment, Waiver, or Modification. No amendment, waiver, or modification of this Agreement shall be binding unless it is in writing and signed by both PTI QCS and CUSTOMER and dated after the date hereof. Performance of work by PTI QCS and/or acceptance of payment by PTI QCS for work performed and/or work to be performed for CUSTOMER beyond the scope of this Agreement does not constitute acceptance by PTI QCS of amendments or modifications to this Agreement nor shall they be binding. <br/>
